WebWorker

WebWorker: "A thread in Javascript"

http://dev.w3.org/html5/workers/

reminder: 
Javascript is monothreaded
Javascript is massively event based
Javascript is not done for massive computation

Web workers:
 - launch a computation without blocking the IO
 - Split a computation on multiples cores (map reduces, ...)

Shared web workers:
a spec inside the spec

 - shared states between windows (easier than window.postMessage for multiples windows)
 - use a pop up/ windows just like an iframe
